## Hello Again
Last year I wrote a [post](https://dev.to/dlionz/what-am-i-doing-here-1lg4) about my feelings attending my first developer meetup and imposter syndrome. I'm now back with more of my feelings about being part of the larger developer community.

As always, thanks for reading.

## Is it okay to just be?

I want someone to tell me it's okay. It's okay that I don't code on weekends. It's okay that I don't dedicate my free time to coding, it's okay I haven't built anything "cool", it's okay that being a developer isn't a burning passion but rather just a job (albeit a very fun one).

I feel there's implicit pressure to dedicate every waking moment of my day to programming in order to be a "real" dev. When I go to places like [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) all I see are gatekeeping-esque statements to the effect of "You shouldn't try and be a developer if you're just in it for the money", but why not! The money is good in this field and if that's what drives someone to pursue it then go for it! (Obviously, don't let your capitalistic thirst leech your soul of every last drop of morality â€” looking at you, Bezos.)

I look at all the cool things that pop up on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and the fact that I don't contribute in the same way to the coding community does get me down. Even more so when I acknowledge that I don't even have the innate desire to start doing so. 

I'm in these communities because I love to see what people are creating, I just hate the inevitable imposter syndrome that comes with the exposure to the incredible projects other developers undertake. I wish there were more posts out there that mention that it's okay to exclusively lurk [Dev.to](https://dev.to/). It's okay if you haven't taught yourself any new languages. It's okay to just be a dev 9-5, and that you are still a valid member of the community with experiences that matter, even though in your free time you'd rather sell turnips to raccoon children than contribute to open-source code or make the next cool Chrome extension.
