##This weekend

I want to spend some time make thins site a little more interesting to look at. Both for me and whoever happens to stumble in. I'll be using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my styling and ill also look into some plugins for twitter possibly, or I'll do none of this and just play Hearthstone or something :D

-- UPDATE Sun, Apr 19 -- 
Welp, turns out tailwind is a real bastard to work with so didn't make any progress there and as a result didn't add anything to the random page. Oh Well
