We are now halfway through the year, hot damn did it fly by. 

things I've been up to. 

* Got my skateboard from Houston so I've been trying that 
* Still practicing my drawing
* Looked into note-taking apps (Bear: I need to be a better listener and note-taker).
* Spent a lot of today looking at Clip Studio a drawing App for mac/pc
* looked into drawing tablets
* watched a lot of videos of people moving to new york (Exciting to watch people make these big life changes)
* Looked on Zillow for apartments near me that feel more home-like.
