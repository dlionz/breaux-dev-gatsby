When I was younger I used to draw all the time, Its something I enjoyed and shared with my friends. However as I got older one of my close friends became so good at drawing that eventually I became self-conscious of my work and just gave it up altogether. Recently in an effort to find a hobby and just doing something that is creative and that I enjoy outside of videogames I've taken up drawing. Below are some of my works in practicing Gesture.

All done on an Ipad with Apple Pencil and Procreate. you can find my other work [HERE](https://www.instagram.com/damien_learns_to_draw/)
