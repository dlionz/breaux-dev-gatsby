So I'm not going to miss the first day after I said I'd do this 100-day writing challenge. Been feeling stressed at work lately. Not because the work is hard, or there is more of it. Everything just feels different now that we've been in a shelter in place for what feels like 84 years. There aren't really breaks in the days/weeks. Work hours feel like off-hours and off-hours feel like work hours. I'm already a remote developer and have been for over a year now, but this just feels very different. This also makes my imposter syndrome kick up harder cause I feel like I'm not doing as much at work / or contributing in meaningful ways, but I guess we are all feeling like that lately.
