Over this holiday weeekened to spent some time trying to utilize [Netlify Large Media plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/overview/). The idea seemed cool enough and by the docs the process seemed pretty straight forward but it didnt turn out that way and here we are today not using it. 

My problem was I was able to setup the repo to use GIT LFS and everything seemed to be going well, but when I built and deployed the site my images/image wasnt rendering to the page. I searched and searched and I could not find an answer to my problem. I think maybe I was trying to use LFS in a way that its not actually used for. 

Oh well, thats what I did this weekend. I also played alot of GTA V, and going to read about mobile list UI later.
